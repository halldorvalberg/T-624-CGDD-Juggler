# T-624-CGDD-Juggler
Juggler is a simple arcade-style game developed using Unity, in which the player must keep a cow from hurtling into outer space with a UFO. The game features simple 2D graphics and physics, and is designed to be easy to learn but challenging to master.

Gameplay
In this intergalactic adventure, you join a group of aliens on their mission to transport a cow from Earth to their home planet. Unfortunately, during the journey, the cow is accidentally ejected from the spacecraft, and if it drifts into deep space, it will be lost forever. The aliens quickly activate the tractor beam on their UFO and catch the cow mid-air, but soon realize that its weight and shape make it difficult to control. The cow keeps bouncing off the walls of the UFO, and the aliens know they have to act fast to prevent it from hurtling into deep space.

To save the cow, the aliens decide to rotate the UFO and use its curved walls to bounce the cow back and forth, just like a game of pong. Your mission is to help the aliens control the cow's movements and guide it safely back to their planet. The fate of the beloved bovine hangs in the balance, and only you can help the aliens save it! Are you ready for the great cow bouncing adventure?
